# gba_verilog
Implementation of Game Boy Advance hardware on Virtex 5 FPGA

## To do:
1. Top level/pipeline logic
	1. Branch logic
	1. Data forwarding
1. PSR unit
1. THUMB decompressor
1. Memory module (use dummy connections for now)


## Needs more work
1. Multiplier (for MLAL, need to pipeline and take in two more operands)


## Ready to test:
1. ALU
1. Control Unit
1. Conditional execution unit
1. Register addressing unit
1. Register file
1. Barrel shifter
